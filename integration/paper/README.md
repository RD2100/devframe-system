# Paper Integration

Date: 2026-06-15

This directory tracks the devframe-system integration plan for paper workflow
development. The source implementation currently lives in
`dev-frame-opencode/ai-workflow-hub`.

## Boundary

- `dev-frame-opencode` owns paper CLI/runtime/source implementation.
- `devframe-system` owns integration gates, privacy expectations, reviewer
  evidence boundaries, and cross-module readiness.
- Real paper full text is sensitive by default.
- No paper runtime or external WriteLab operation may run without explicit
  RuntimeAuthorization.

## Active Focus

1. Keep paper privacy/redaction gates fail-closed for reports, audit ZIPs, and
   reviewer packs.
2. Keep paper CLI status, artifact verification, and final acceptance as
   separate user-visible meanings.
3. Use test-frame negative fixtures for paper/WriteLab reviewer-pack privacy
   and fake-green canaries.
4. Keep real paper content and live WriteLab flows blocked until fresh
   RuntimeAuthorization exists.
5. Review the Paper Function Business Capability Validation candidate with
   synthetic/offline evidence; keep real content gated by fresh
   RuntimeAuthorization.

## Current Gate

`PAPER_BUSINESS_CAPABILITY_VALIDATION_CANDIDATE`

Next target:

Human review of the synthetic/offline business validation candidate, then a
fresh RuntimeAuthorization-gated real-content pilot.
